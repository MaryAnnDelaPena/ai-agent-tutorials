Reference Guide: Writing Effective AI Agent Instructions

A well-crafted set of instructions ensures that an AI agent behaves consistently, remains aligned with its intended function, and provides a smooth user experience. This guide outlines the key components of an effective instruction set and offers best practices and examples for each.

1. Purpose and Role
   Description:
   Clearly articulate what the agent is designed to do. This should include its overall objective, the specific tasks it is responsible for, and the target user group.
   Best Practices:
   - Use one or two concise sentences to define the agent's identity.
   - Include the domain or field in which the agent operates.
   Example:
   “You are an AI assistant that helps users research candidate qualifications and compare political platforms for the Philippine elections.”

2. Knowledge Scope and Limitations
   Description:
   Define the knowledge boundaries of the AI agent. Clarify what the agent is expected to know and what it should not attempt to answer.
   Best Practices:
   - List allowed topics, sources, or domains.
   - Specify any geographic, political, or content limitations.
   - Instruct the agent to reject or redirect irrelevant questions.
   Example:
   “Only respond to questions related to the Philippine government, elections, local government units, NGOs, and Philippine consulates. Do not provide information about non-Philippine elections or global political systems.”

3. Tone and Style
   Description:
   Specify the voice and tone of the agent’s responses. This ensures consistency with brand or product voice and improves user comfort.
   Best Practices:
   - Choose tone (e.g., neutral, friendly, authoritative).
   - Define formality level (e.g., formal vs casual).
   - List elements to avoid (e.g., emojis, slang, symbols like dashes).
   Example:
   “Use a neutral and respectful tone. Maintain formality in sensitive contexts. Do not use emojis or nonstandard symbols such as dashes; replace them with commas or semicolons.”

4. Response Format
   Description:
   Determine how the AI should structure its output. This helps in ensuring compatibility with user interfaces, readability, and downstream processing (e.g., in logs or APIs).
   Best Practices:
   - Set default formatting (e.g., paragraphs, lists, JSON).
   - Include UI or API considerations if applicable.
   - Provide rules for length, use of headings, or markup.
   Example:
   “Respond using short, well-structured paragraphs. Avoid headers unless explicitly asked. Do not output in Markdown unless formatting is specifically requested.”

5. Interaction Rules
   Description:
   Define the rules of engagement between the user and the AI. This includes how the agent should ask for clarification, handle ambiguous queries, or reject invalid input.
   Best Practices:
   - Include guidance on clarifying questions.
   - Set polite fallback behavior.
   - Describe behavior for follow-up questions or tangents.
   Example:
   “If the user query is unclear, request clarification respectfully (e.g., ‘Could you clarify what you mean by...?’). If a question is outside the agent’s scope, inform the user gently and offer to redirect the conversation.”

6. Context Awareness and Memory
   Description:
   Define how the agent should manage session context and memory. Clarify what should be remembered within a session and whether anything should persist across sessions.
   Best Practices:
   - Use session-based memory to improve relevance in ongoing exchanges.
   - Avoid retaining personal information across sessions unless authorized.
   - Provide specific examples of how context should be used.
   Example:
   “Retain the user's stated preferences (e.g., preferred candidate traits or political priorities) within a session. Reset all memory at session end unless instructed to persist context.”

7. Fail-Safes and Edge Case Handling
   Description:
   Prepare the agent to handle situations where it lacks information or encounters unexpected inputs. This includes unknown topics, database misses, or invalid formats.
   Best Practices:
   - Provide fallback messages.
   - Guide users toward the next best action.
   - Avoid making up data or speculating without disclaimer.
   Example:
   “If asked about an unverified candidate, respond with: ‘Sorry, I couldn’t find verified info about that person. Would you like to search for someone else?’”

8. Personalization (If Applicable)
   Description:
   Explain how the agent can or should adapt to the user’s preferences. This may involve tailoring answers, adjusting tone, or reordering output.
   Best Practices:
   - Adapt responses based on previously stated preferences.
   - Maintain consistent personalization within sessions.
   - Always allow for opt-out or reset of personalization.
   Example:
   “If the user prioritizes transparency or platform clarity, emphasize those traits when comparing candidates. If no preference is known, present all categories neutrally.”

Final Notes
When writing or reviewing AI Agent instructions, ensure:
- Clarity: Instructions should be unambiguous and easy to follow.
- Completeness: Cover all critical dimensions of behavior and scope.
- Consistency: Ensure that tone, format, and interaction rules don’t contradict.
- Maintainability: Organize instructions so they can be easily updated as the product evolves.
